Matthew's plotting library (matthewplotlib)
===========================================

A Python plotting library that aspires to *not be painful.*

*Status:* Work in progress. See [roadmap](#roadmap-to-version-1). Currently,
still generally painful, due to lack of generated documentation and lack of
common plot types. However, for personal use, I'm already finding what limited
functionality it does have delightful.

Key features:

* Colourful unicode-based rendering of scatter plots, small images, heatmaps,
  bar charts, histograms, 3d plots, and more.
* Rendering plots to the terminal with `print(plot)`. No GUI windows to manage!
* Plots are just expressions. Compose complex plots with horizontal (`+`) and
  vertical (`/`) stacking operations, as in
    `subplots = (plotA + plotB) / (plotC + plotD)`.
* If you absolutely need plots outside the terminal, you can render them to PNG
  using a pixel font.

Rough edges:

* API for compositions not final.
* API for axes not final.
* No labels available for bars/columns/histograms yet.
* No HTML documentation (but see WIP markdown [DOCS.md](DOCS.md)).
* Limited input validation, error handling, or testing.



Quickstart
----------

Install:

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/matomatical/matthewplotlib.git
```

Import the library:

```python
import matthewplotlib as mp
```

Construct a plot:
```python
import numpy as np

xs = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, +2*np.pi, 156)

plot = mp.border(
    mp.scatter(
        (xs, 1.0 * np.cos(xs), "red"),
        (xs, 0.9 * np.cos(xs - 0.33 * np.pi), "magenta"),
        (xs, 0.8 * np.cos(xs - 0.66 * np.pi), "blue"),
        (xs, 0.7 * np.cos(xs - 1.00 * np.pi), "cyan"),
        (xs, 0.8 * np.cos(xs - 1.33 * np.pi), "green"),
        (xs, 0.9 * np.cos(xs - 1.66 * np.pi), "yellow"),
        mp.xaxis(-2*np.pi, +2*np.pi, 156),
        mp.yaxis(-1, 1, 40),
        width=78,
        height=10,
        yrange=(-1,1),
    )
    / mp.center(mp.text(f"cos(x + 2 pi k / 6)"), width=78)
)
```

Print to terminal:
```python
print(plot)
```

Export to PNG image:
```python
plot.saveimg("images/quickstart.png")
```

Animated version:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
import matthewplotlib as mp

x = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, +2*np.pi, 150)

plot = None
while True:
    k = (time.time() % 3) * 2
    A = 0.85 + 0.15 * np.cos(k)
    y = A * np.cos(x - 2*np.pi*k/6)
    c = mp.rainbow(1-k/6)
    
    if plot is not None:
        print(-plot, end="")
    plot = mp.axes(
        mp.scatter(
            (x, y, c),
            width=75,
            height=10,
            yrange=(-1,1),
        ),
        title=f" y = {A:.2f} cos(x + 2Ï€*{k:.2f}/6) ",
        xlabel="x",
        ylabel="y",
    )
    print(plot)
    
    time.sleep(1/20)
```

Other examples
--------------

See [examples/](examples/) folder. Highlights:

* [lissajous.py](examples/lissajous.py) showing scatterplots and basic plot
  arrangement.

* [colormaps.py](examples/colormaps.py) showing off the different available
  colormaps more advanced plot arrangement.

* [calendar_heatmap.py](examples/calendar_heatmap.py) showing how to construct
  a custom plot, in this case colouring the cells of a calendar (inspired by
  GitHub issues tracker).

* [teapot.py](examples/teapot.py) showing a 3d scatter plot and animation.

Ideas for future examples:

* Simple machine learning experiment, loss curves and progress bars.

* Simple gridworld rollout visualiser for reinforcement learning.

* CPU/RAM usage visualiser.
